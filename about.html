				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p>We are a community in Dublin, a town in New Zealand. We run a club called Board games aficionados. As the name implies this club prides itself on keeping tradional board game playing active. With all the online and video game activty today it is no wonder the traditional board game playing is a dying practice. Even these humble games have become fantastic digital equivalents.</p>
				<p>This club meets regulary to play some of these board games. We meet up at each others houses or in some cases we would hold a social event and rent out a conference room. The larger events tend to include some competitions and the results recorded.</p>
				<p>Our club currently has a membership of around 30 with a committed core group of 20 or so. We are always keen to welcome new members. All equipment is provided by the club. There is no annual fee but members pay a weekly sub of $2.50 on the nights they attend.</p>
